# CRUD

 ------- CRUD ------- 

ðŸŸ¦ In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of persistent storage.CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports. The term was likely first popularized by James Martin in his 1983 book Managing the Data-base environment.

ðŸŸ¦ The acronym CRUD refers to the major operations which are implemented by databases. Each letter in the acronym can be mapped to a standard Structured Query Language (SQL) statement.

CRUD	SQL
Create	INSERT
Read	SELECT
Update	UPDATE
Delete	DELETE

ðŸŸ¦ Although relational databases are a common persistence layer in software applications, numerous other persistence layers exist. CRUD functionality can for example be implemented with document databases, object databases, XML databases, text files, or binary files.

Note: Some big data systems do not implement UPDATE, but have only a timestamped INSERT (journaling), storing a completely new version of the object each time.
